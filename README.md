# Data Analysis Project using SQL: 

## Objective

The goal of this data analysis project is to identify strategies and insights that can help increase the occupancy rate of low-performing flights, thereby improving the overall profitability for the airline.

## Prerequisites

- SQLite database with the required tables and data.
- Python libraries: `sqlite3`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

## Steps

1. Importing Libraries: Import the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.

2. Database Connection: Establish a connection with the SQLite database and retrieve the list of tables present.

3. Data Exploration: Explore the tables in the database by retrieving sample data and examining the table structures.

4. Analysis: Perform various SQL queries to answer specific questions and gain insights. Some example queries are provided in the code:

   - Identify the planes with more than 100 seats.
   - Analyze how the number of tickets booked and total amount earned changed over time.
   - Calculate the average charges for each aircraft with different fare conditions.

5. Data Visualization: Visualize the results of the analysis using appropriate plots and charts and write a report as pdf.

## Results

The analysis provides insights into the occupancy rates of low-performing flights and suggests potential strategies for increasing their occupancy. The visualizations help understand the trends and patterns in ticket bookings and total earnings over time.
